        <h2>Driving Progress Across Construction, Demolition & Beyond</h2>
        <p>
          At AAA Construction Equipment, we carry a legacy of trust, reliability, and deep industry roots. For over 60 years, our team worked in close partnership with CASE Construction Equipment, supporting their products through sales, service, and strong customer relationships across the construction industry. That long-standing alliance helped shape who we are — a team built on expertise, integrity, and a customer-first mindset.

        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
         Our story began over 60 years ago, rooted in a powerful partnership with CASE and CAT Construction Equipment. For decades, we stood alongside one of the most respected names in the industry not just selling and servicing machines, but building lasting relationships and becoming a trusted resource for contractors across the region. Today, AAA Construction Equipment stands as a medium-sized, family-owned company with a modern approach and old-school values. Our relationship with CASE and CAT remains strong, and we continue to support their equipment while expanding our offerings to meet broader industry needs. From our early days in dealership support to becoming a full-service provider of sales, rentals, parts, and service, our journey has always been guided by one thing: a commitment to the people who trust us to keep their operations moving. We’ve come a long way and we’re just getting started.

       <h2>Our History</h2>
          <p>
            AAA Construction Equipment is built on a legacy of excellence that spans over 60 years in the construction equipment industry. Our roots trace back to a long-standing partnership with CASE Construction Equipment, where our team earned its reputation through decades of dedicated service, expert support, and unwavering customer commitment.
            What began as a collaborative effort within a larger organization has evolved into a proudly independent, family-owned company. After years of industry experience and customer trust, we launched AAA Construction Equipment to create a brand that reflects our values, our identity, and our forward-looking vision.
            While we’ve grown into our own name, the foundation remains the same — reliability, hands-on knowledge, and strong relationships with both our customers and manufacturers. Our enduring relationship with CASE continues to be a key part of our journey, and we’ve expanded our partnerships to include a range of trusted brands and equipment solutions.
            Today, we stand as a medium-sized company with deep industry roots, serving contractors, developers, and equipment operators with the same passion and work ethic that defined our beginnings. Our history isn’t just where we come from — it’s what drives us to keep building stronger every day.
