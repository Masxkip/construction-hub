        <h2>Building the Future, One Machine at a Time</h2>
        <p>
          At <strong>Company Wrench</strong>, we go beyond simply selling or renting heavy equipment — we provide
          powerful, tailored solutions for the construction, demolition, recycling, scrap, utility,
          and forestry industries. With over two decades of experience, we’ve built a reputation
          as one of the most trusted names in specialty equipment, combining innovation, expertise,
          and a relentless drive to help our customers succeed.

        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Company Wrench began in 1999 with a commitment to hands-on service and a customer-first
          approach. In 2001, we pivoted from truck repair into the heavy equipment market. Our
          rental program, initially focused on LaBounty-equipped excavators, quickly became a hit.
          By 2005, we had earned the title of the world's #1 LaBounty dealer — a distinction we
          still hold. Our growth since then has been propelled by quality service, trusted
          partnerships, and an unmatched work ethic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Company Wrench operates 13 full-service branches across eight U.S. states, offering
          sales, rentals, service, and parts from the industry's most respected manufacturers,
          including Kobelco, JCB, SANY, Fuchs, Bandit, Prinoth, and more.
